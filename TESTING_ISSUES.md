# Testing Issues

This document outlines the issues encountered while trying to run the automated tests for this project.

## Problem

The `npm test` command, which is the standard way to run tests in a Create React App project, consistently times out after approximately 6-7 minutes. This happens even when running the tests in non-watch mode (`npm test -- --watchAll=false`).

## Attempts to Resolve

The following attempts were made to resolve the issue, without success:

*   **`npm test`**: This command starts the test runner in watch mode, but it becomes unresponsive and eventually times out.
*   **`npm test -- --watchAll=false`**: This command is supposed to run the tests once and exit, but it also times out.
*   **`./node_modules/.bin/react-scripts test --watchAll=false`**: Running the test script directly also results in a timeout.

## Current Status

Due to these issues, it is currently not possible to run the automated test suite. The root cause of the problem is unknown, but it seems to be related to the test environment setup.

## Recommendation

As per the project guidelines, manual testing is the recommended way to verify the functionality of the application until this issue is resolved. Please refer to the `README.md` file for instructions on how to perform manual testing.
